# Manta apps

Applications for the [Manta](http://www.snyderphonics.com/products.htm).

MantaOSC is a simple app which sends and receives Manta data over OSC.

MantaOSC_advanced is the same as MantaOSC but with additional high-level statistics and velocities for more sophisticated inputs.

MantaLearn is an experimental (currently not working yet) application which will use machine learning to train a set of output variables controlled by Manta input data (and also sends OSC).
